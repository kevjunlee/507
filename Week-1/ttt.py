# Create board - Setup the data structure for storing board data

# Loop until game is over
    
    # Step 1: Print board
    '''
    This function will take in current board data and print out the board in the console as shown 
    in the instructions.
    parameter: board_data - a data structure used for holding current moves on the board
    return: None
    '''
    def print_board(board_data):
        pass

    # Step 2: 
    '''
    This function will ask players to input their move onto the board (specifically an X or O). Once
    player inputs their move, it will call the next function
    return: None '''
    # Step 3:
    '''
    This function will verify whether or not the input move is valid. If not valid as an X or O,
    then it will print: "ERROR, input valid move!" and ask for input until it is a valid answer.
    This will then determine if the game is over after a valid input. If the game is not over,
    game will move onto the next function
    return: None
    '''
    # Step 4:
    '''
    This function will update the game board if the move is valid and also the game is not over.
    return: None

    '''
    # Step 5: Determine if game is over
    '''
    Take in the current board data and determine if one player wins the game or the game draws. If the game is over,
    terminate the loop, or continue the loop.
    parameter: board_data - current board data
    return: information about current game status
